  <h1>A recent trip to Thailand</h1>

    <p class="note_txt">I had the fortune of spending two amazing weeks in Thailand this fall. My husband and I started our trip off in Bangkok, hitting many of the major sites including Wat Pho, the Grand Palace, and Baiyoke Sky Tower for some amazing views of the city. </p>

    <p class="note_txt">The next day we did a boat ride to Ayutthaya and a bike ride around the old capital of Thailand to look at many of temple ruins there. Our next stop (after a very late, overnight train ride) was Chaing Mai. We spent our first day there at the Elephant Nature Park and had an unbelievably amazing time with some of the rescue elephants there. The park is also home to over 400 rescue dogs and cats.</p>

    <p class="note_txt">Up next was a 3-day, 2-night hike through the jungle of northern Thailand. We hiked up and down several mountains, up a river, and through a bat cave. The views of the countryside were spectacular as were the people we met in the villages we passed through.</p>
